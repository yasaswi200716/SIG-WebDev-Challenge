I built a responsive Photo Gallery web app using ReactJS. It allows users to view curated photos by category and also includes a keyword-based search filter using:
<li>ReactJS (functional components)</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>HTML & CSS</li>
<li>Used Unsplash image links</li>
<hr>
<h3>Project structure</h3>
<li>App.js: Root component that handles category and search logic.</li>
<li>Gallery.js: Renders the filtered photo cards.</li>
<li>data.js: Stores image data (URL, title, category).</li>
<li>index.js: Renders the app to the DOM.</li>
<li>index.html: Base HTML in the public folder.</li>
<hr>
<h3>Functionality:</h3>
Real-time search by image title
Category-based filtering (Mountains, Beaches, Forest, City, Deserts)
Clean UI with responsive layout
Fully functional filtering and search system with no backend
