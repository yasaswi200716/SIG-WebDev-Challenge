## What I learned 
- used fetch() to send request to server for data.
- used response.json() to change the data to json format.
- .then(response => {...}) checks the response sent by NASA. it runs when it gets a response.
- used efficient some exception handling concepts. like throw, catch
-  .then(data => { ... }) puts the data into webpage.
